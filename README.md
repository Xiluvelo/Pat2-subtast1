# PAT2 - Subtask 1: Morse Code Research

## What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a communication system that uses a series of dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. It was developed to transmit messages over long distances using telegraph wires.

## History of Morse Code
Morse code was invented by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the 1830s. It was created specifically for use with the electrical telegraph, which was a new technology that could send messages over wires across long distances much faster than mail.

## How Does Morse Code Work?
Each letter, number, and punctuation mark has a unique combination of dots and dashes:
- A dot (.) is a short signal
- A dash (-) is three times longer than a dot
- Spaces between dots/dashes in the same letter are very short
- Spaces between letters are longer
- Spaces between words are even longer

## Morse Code Examples
Here are some words translated to Morse code:
- **HELLO:** .... . .-.. .-.. ---
- **SOS** (distress signal): ... --- ...
- **PAT:** .--. .- -
